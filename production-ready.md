## to do list, dev 
- This is where i might include a to-do list for myself and other devs on team. 


## to do list, pre-production
- <em> This is a list to be done right before production, but after dev is done. Sometimes these have to be
regenerated so it's better to wait until you have completed most if not all of dev. This is a preflight checklist 
before taking a spa, web app or website live. This can also vary if this is a CMS build </em>

- generate a web app manifest (pwa requires it)

- we generally want to ask users about cookies as good dev practice and to abide by regulations
